Perfect — you’re moving to **Next.js 14 (App Router)** + TypeScript + Tailwind + MongoDB mock data.
Deployment here is **different** from Vite/CRA React because Next.js needs proper hosting.

Let’s handle this in **two parts**:

## ✅ 2. Build & Deploy

### 🔹 Build Command
```bash
npm run build
````

Next.js generates a `.next/` build folder.

---

### 🔹 Deployment Options

Since **Next.js App Router does not work with GitHub Pages** (it needs Node.js runtime), you should deploy to:

* **Vercel (Recommended)** — free, made by Next.js creators
* **Netlify** — easy & free
* **Render** — also free for hobby projects

---


⚡ Question for you:
👉 Do you want me to **write the GitHub Actions config** so it **auto-deploys to Vercel every time you push** (like we did with GitHub Pages), or do you prefer just **manual one-click Vercel deploy**?
